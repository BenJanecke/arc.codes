Architect makes it easy to share code across many Lambda functions. Apps most commonly need to share business logic and view templates so Architect provides `@shared` and `@views` capability. Architect copies the contents of `src/shared` into all Lambdas and `src/views` into Lambda functions wired to respond to `@http` GET requests.

Example `app.arc`

```arc
@app
myapp

@shared
src src/shared # this is the default

@views
src src/views # this is the default

@http
get /
post /like
```

No matter where `@shared` source is configured it gets copied to every Lambda. The destination is slightly different depending on runtime:

| Runtime | `@shared` destination |
| --- | --- |
| Node | `src/http/get-index/node_modules/@architect/shared` |
| Ruby | `src/http/get-index/vendor/shared` |
| Python | `src/http/get-index/vendor/shared` |

Likewise, `@views` runtime destinations:

| Runtime | `@views` destination |
| --- | --- |
| Node | `src/http/get-index/node_modules/@architect/views` |
| Ruby | `src/http/get-index/vendor/views` |
| Python | `src/http/get-index/vendor/views` |

> Tip: the entire contents of `src/shared` are copied so we strongly suggest keeping the directory structure as flat as possible, and the payloads as small as possible to ensure the best performance.

## Dependencies

`@shared` and `@views` support having their own dependencies defined by `package.json`, `requirements.txt` or `Gemfile`.
