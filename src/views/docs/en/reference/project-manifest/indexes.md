description: Define DynamoDB table global secondary indexes.
---

Defines [Global Secondary Indexes][gsi] for your project's [DynamoDB][ddb] tables. `@indexes` should only ever be paired with [`@tables`][tables].

## Recommended

[DynamoDB][ddb] is a powerful database, though different from both SQL and NoSQL databases. It is highly recommended to dig into Amazon's resources to familiarize yourself with it:

- [DynamoDB Core Components (start here!)][core]
- [Global Secondary Indexes in DynamoDB][gsi]
- [Amazon's full DynamoDB documentation][ddb]

## Syntax

- `@indexes` is a feature subset of [`@tables`][tables]; as such, the names of your declared indexes must match those of your [`@tables`][tables]
- Otherwise, the basic syntax for defining `@indexes` primary keys is the same as [`@tables`][tables]:
  - Partition key, defined by a `*`, is required
  - Sort key, defined by `**`, is optional
  - Currently only `*String`, `**String`, `*Number` and `**Number` are supported
- An optional `name` property can be provided to explicitly name the index. This is helpful when [querying the index with the AWS SDK as you know what to pass to the `IndexName` query parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/DynamoDB/DocumentClient.html#query-property)
- An optional `projection` property can be provided to explicitly define which [item attributes get projected][projection], or included, in query results. By default, arc will project _all_ item attributes (the `ALL` projection type as described in the [DynamoDB documentation on attribute projections][projection])
  - ðŸ’¸ Customizing which attributes to project can be helpful when trying to save on [storage costs][pricing]
  - Note that once a projection is defined, it cannot be changed; a new index would need to be created
  - Acceptable values for `projection` are:
    - `all`: the default, all item attributes from the table are projected into the index
    - `keys`: only the base table primary (and sort, if defined) keys as well as the index primary (and sort, if defined) keys are projected into the index
    - custom: otherwise, you may define one or more attribute names to explicitly project into the index. Note that the base table and index keys always get projected

## Example

The following `app.arc` file defines a [DynamoDB][ddb] table with two named [Global Secondary Indexes][gsi], both with `projection` explicitly defined:
